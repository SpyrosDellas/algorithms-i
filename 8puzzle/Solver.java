 * Description:
 * We implement an 8-puzzle problem solver using the A* search algorithm. We
 * define a search node of the game to be a board, the number of moves made to
 * reach the board, and the previous search node. First, we insert the initial
 * search node (the initial board, 0 moves, and a null previous search node)
 * into a priority queue. Then, we delete from the priority queue the search
 * node with the minimum priority, and insert onto the priority queue all
 * neighboring search nodes (those that can be reached in one move from the
 * dequeued search node). We repeat this procedure until the search node
 * dequeued corresponds to the goal board.
 * The efficacy of this approach hinges on the choice of priority function for
 * a search node. We consider two priority functions:
 * - The Hamming priority function is the Hamming distance of a board plus the
 *   number of moves made so far to get to the search node. Intuitively, a
 *   search node with a small number of tiles in the wrong position is close to
 *   the goal, and we prefer a search node if has been reached using a small
 *   number of moves.
 * - The Manhattan priority function is the Manhattan distance of a board plus
 *   the number of moves made so far to get to the search node.
 * To solve the puzzle from a given search node on the priority queue, the total
 * number of moves we need to make (including those already made) is at least
 * its priority, using either the Hamming or Manhattan priority function.
 * Consequently, when the goal board is dequeued, we have discovered not only a
 * sequence of moves from the initial board to the goal board, but one that
 * makes the fewest moves.
 *
 * Optimisation 1:
 * A* search has one annoying feature: search nodes corresponding to the same
 * board are enqueued on the priority queue many times. To reduce unnecessary
 * exploration of useless search nodes, when considering the neighbors of a
 * search node, we don't enqueue a neighbor if its board is the same as the
 * board of the previous search node in the game tree.
 *
 * Optimisation 2:
 * To avoid recomputing the Manhattan priority of a search node from scratch
 * each time during various priority queue operations, we pre-compute its value
 * when we construct the search node and save it in an instance variable.
 *
 * Detecting unsolvable boards:
 * Not all initial boards can lead to the goal board by a sequence of moves. To
 * detect such situations, we use the fact that boards are divided into two
 * equivalence classes with respect to reachability:
 *  - Those that can lead to the goal board
 *  - Those that can lead to the goal board if we modify the initial board by
 *    swapping any pair of tiles (the blank square is not a tile).
 * To apply the fact, we run the A* algorithm on two puzzle instances - one with
 * the initial board and one with the initial board modified by swapping a pair
 * of tilesâ€”in lockstep (alternating back and forth between exploring search
 * nodes in each of the two game trees). Exactly one of the two will lead to
 * the goal board.
 *
 * Corner case:
 * Throws an IllegalArgumentException in the constructor if the argument is null
